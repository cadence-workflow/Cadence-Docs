I know we are a little early this month as many people will be taking some time out for holidays.

## Happy Holidays ##

We'd like to wish everyone happy holidays and to thank you for being part of the Cadence community. It's been a busy year for Cadence as we have continued to build a strong, active community that works together to solve issues and generally support each other.

Let's keep going!...This is a great way to build a sustainable community.

We are sure that 2023 will be even more exciting as we continue to develop Cadence.
