Welcome back to the latest in our regular Cadence community spotlight updates where we aim to deliver you news from in and around the Cadence community! 
It’s been a few months since our [last update](https://cadenceworkflow.io/blog/2023/11/30/community-spotlight-update-november-2023/), so I have a bunch of exciting updates to share. 

Let’s get started!

## Proposal for Cadence Plugin System ##
Community member [Mantas Sidlauskas](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/mantassidlauskas) drafted a thorough proposal around putting together a plugin system in Cadence. Aimed at enhancing the flexibility of integrating various components like storage, document search, and archival, this system encourages the use of external plugins, promoting innovation and reducing dependency complications. Your insights and feedback are crucial; learn more and contribute your thoughts at the link below:

A huge thank you to Mantas for initiating this work. This is an excellent example of how we can collaborate together to bring about new features that benefit us all. 

## Admin API Permissions Rethinking ##
The community is deliberating on the permission requirements for the Admin API DescribeCluster endpoint. This vital discussion aims to ensure Cadence web's accessibility across different user levels. We're exploring various solutions and your participation would greatly influence the decision-making process. Feel free to chime in [here](https://github.com/uber/cadence/issues/5683)! 

## New Java Samples for Cadence: Signal Workflow Interactions ##
In some exciting news for Java enthusiasts, a new sample has been added to the Cadence Java Samples repository, demonstrating how to initiate and interact with a signal workflow using the Cadence client. This practical example is a huge win for developers looking to deepen their understanding of workflow signaling in Java. Explore the new sample and expand your Cadence toolkit [here](https://github.com/uber/cadence-java-samples/pull/78).
