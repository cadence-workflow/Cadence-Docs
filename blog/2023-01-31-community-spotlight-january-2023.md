Happy New Year everyone! Hereâ€™s the latest in our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Closing Down Cadence Office Hours ##
We have been running Office Hours sessions every month since May last year. The aim was to give the community an opportunity to speak directly with some of the Cadence core developers and experts to answer questions on particular issues you may be having. We have found that the most preferred method for community questions has been the support Slack channel so have decided to stop this monthly call.

Thanks very much to [Ender Demirkaya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/enderdemirkaya/)and the Uber team for making themselves available for these sessions.

Please remember that if you have question about Cadence or are facing a specific issue then  you can post your question in our #support [Slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack) channel. If you also post the details on StackOverflow with the cadence workflow tag then there will be a searchable history for others who encounter the same issue to find a solution.

## Update on iWF Support for Cadence ##
Last October we featured an update in our monthly blog about [iWF - Interpreter for Workflow](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf), a project built on top of Cadence by community member [Quanzheng Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/). It was announced recently that iWF has released a [Golang SDK](https://github.com/iworkflowio/iwf-golang-sdk) and updated  versions of the [Java SDK and server](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf).

Long is really keen to get feedback so please take a look at iWF, try them out and presented him any feedback.
Long has also created a couple of blog posts about iWF that we have featured in the Cadence in the News section below so please take a look.
