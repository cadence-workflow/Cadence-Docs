# Workflow Sleep

The `workflow.Sleep` function allows a Cadence workflow to pause its execution for a specified duration. This is similar to `time.Sleep` in Go, but is safe and deterministic for use within Cadence workflows. The workflow will be paused and resumed by the Cadence service, and the sleep is durableâ€”meaning the workflow can survive worker restarts or failures during the sleep period.

## Example: Sleep for 30 Seconds

Here is a minimal example of using `workflow.Sleep` in a Cadence workflow, as demonstrated in [cadence-samples PR #99](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-samples/pull/99):

```go
import (
    "time"
    "go.uber.org/cadence/workflow"
)

func SleepWorkflow(ctx workflow.Context) error {
    workflow.GetLogger(ctx).Info("Workflow started, going to sleep for 30 seconds...")
    err := workflow.Sleep(ctx, 30*time.Second)
    if err != nil {
        workflow.GetLogger(ctx).Error("Sleep interrupted", "Error", err)
        return err
    }
    workflow.GetLogger(ctx).Info("Woke up after 30 seconds!")
    return nil
}
```

### Key Points
- Use `workflow.Sleep(ctx, duration)` instead of `time.Sleep` inside workflow code.
- The sleep is durable: if the worker crashes or restarts, the workflow will resume sleeping where it left off.
- The workflow is not consuming worker resources while sleeping; the state is persisted by Cadence.
- You can use any duration supported by Go's `time.Duration`.

### When to Use
- Delaying workflow progress for a fixed period (e.g., retry with backoff, scheduled reminders, timeouts).
- Waiting for an external event or timeout before proceeding.

### Limitations
- Do not use `time.Sleep` in workflow code; always use `workflow.Sleep` for determinism and durability.
- Very large numbers of simultaneous timers (sleeps) may impact cluster performance; consider jittering or batching if needed.
