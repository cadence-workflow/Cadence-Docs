# Coding Conventions

This page outlines the coding conventions and standards across Cadence repositories. For language-specific tooling, build instructions, and formatting details, refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repository.

## Pull Request Titles

### Conventional Commits Format

<!-- NEW REQUIREMENT: Conventional Commits for consistency across repos -->
All pull request titles should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

Examples:
feat(worker): Add batch processing API
fix(history): Resolve deadlock in workflow execution
docs: Update getting started guide
```

**Types:**
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process, dependencies, or tools

### PR Title Guidelines

<!-- Source: https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#L253-L265 -->
Follow the [Chris Beams guide](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to writing git commit messages. All PR titles should:

- Start with UPPER case
- Be specific (avoid generic titles like "bug fixes")
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

**Examples from Cadence repositories:**
- [Make sync activity retry multiple times before fetch history from remote](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pull/1379)
- [Enable archival config per domain](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pull/1351)

<!-- Source: https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence-java-client/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#L27-L40 -->
All source files must include the Apache 2.0 license header. Each repository has tools to check and generate headersâ€”see the repository's CONTRIBUTING.md for specific commands.
