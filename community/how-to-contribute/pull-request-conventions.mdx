# Pull Request Conventions

This page outlines pull request conventions and standards across Cadence repositories. For language-specific tooling, build instructions, and formatting details, refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file in each repository.

## Pull Request Titles

### Conventional Commits Format

All pull request titles should follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <description>

Examples:
feat(worker): Add batch processing API
fix(history): Resolve deadlock in workflow execution
docs: Update getting started guide
```

**Types:**
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **refactor**: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to build process, dependencies, or tools

### PR Title Guidelines

Follow the [Chris Beams guide](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) to writing git commit messages. All PR titles should:

- Start with UPPER case
- Be specific (avoid generic titles like "bug fixes")
- Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

**Examples from Cadence repositories:**
- [Make sync activity retry multiple times before fetch history from remote](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pull/1379)
- [Enable archival config per domain](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/pull/1351)

## Signing Commits

The Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) requires all commits to be signed before they can be merged to Cadence repositories. You can fulfill this requirement using either:

- Signing every commit with `-s`: `git commit -s -m "Your commit message"`
- Signing each commit with a GPG key

### Setting up GPG key signing

1. [Generate a new GPG key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/generating-a-new-gpg-key)
2. [Add GPG key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/adding-a-gpg-key-to-your-github-account)
3. [Tell Git about your signing key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/telling-git-about-your-signing-key)
4. Enable automatic signing:
   ```bash
   git config --global commit.gpgsign true
   ```
