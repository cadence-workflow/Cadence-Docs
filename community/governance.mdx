# Cadence Workflow Open Source Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Cadence Workflow project. It defines the roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and contribution guidelines to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability within the Cadence open-source community.

---

## Guiding Principles

The governance of the Cadence project adheres to the following principles:

1. **Meritocracy**: Decisions are guided by technical merit and the value of contributions to the community.  
2. **Transparency**: Discussions, decisions, and contributions are made in public forums.  
3. **Inclusivity**: Contributions are welcome from anyone, regardless of affiliation, experience, or background.  
4. **Sustainability**: Processes are designed to ensure the long-term health and success of the project.

### Meritocracy
Any official role (defined below) in the Cadence project requires a proven track record of contributions. 

Cadence is used in many tier 0-2 services across many companies, which are part of their infra/foundation or core business. This is also necessary to keep Cadence reliable and trustable. We would like to grow our community with people who care about the project and put careful effort into improving it.

Primary contributions are commits, publications in official Cadence mediums (GitHub, cadenceworkflow.io etc.), or community support (over Slack, GitHub, StackOverflow etc.) where the Cadence community can directly benefit from. 

To become eligible for an official role, contributions should sustain for at least 6 months with a convincing case for future commitment. For example, to become a maintainer, a contributor should have regular commits within the last 6 months and should explain how they will continue contributing. 

Candidates need to join at least one community meeting to gain familiarity from other members in related roles and to contribute in project processes.

After being eligible, a contributor could apply to have an official role. Anyone with an official role should disclose their real name publicly apart from their GitHub aliases and provide their emails to the Cadence team for contact purposes. The Technical Steering Committee will then hold a voting process to move forward or to give feedback. 

### Transparency
Plans, roadmaps and projects are posted publicly. Similarly, Cadence community meetings are open to everyone. Planning discussions are held in community meetings. People with official roles are published publicly. Lastly, our decision making process is documented transparently (explained below). 

Our decisions and processes are explained with clear reasons, motivation and goals; which are all based on addressing community needs and improving our technology.

### Inclusivity
The Cadence project strives to have contributions from more and diverse contributors. We believe we can build our best only if we can receive inputs from more people.

Basic contributions such as sending PRs, leaving reviews, creating or responding to issues, and submitting project proposals are open to everyone without requiring any prior approval.

Official roles are open to everyone regardless of affiliation, experience, or background. Our criteria will be merely based on the objective requirements mentioned above.

### Sustainability
Processes are designed to ensure the long-term health and success of the project.

We aim to ensure avoiding bugs, security issues, having unfunded projects, half-done projects, unmaintained issues, launches without ownership. A clear understanding of maintainability is needed for any project’s approval.

We strive to simplify our project to make it easier to understand, contribute, and avoid having a single point of failures.

## Governing Model & Voting Process
Cadence follows an **electoral** governing model where official voting will be held for certain decisions such as becoming an official member, technical discussions (major changes, controversial features, features deprecations, major releases etc.), planning, policy etc. 

A member of TSC can call for voting for a subject in case they want an official opinion from every member. Before any election, two weeks notice should be given to members.

Voting can be held online or offline if a member cannot make the meeting or if a common meeting time cannot be found. Even if the voting happens offline, members can still partially meet online to discuss the case. 

Each election should be posted in a TSC dedicated GitHub repo. Each member is reached via their email, which is shared with every TSC member. It’s the member’s responsibility to provide a working email address in case the email bounces back. The member who calls for voting sends email notifications. 

Voting has to be recorded and should clearly show a vote was casted from the voters account (email or GitHub or another account officially linked to the voter). A vote could be in “favor”, “not in favor” or “abstain”.

In case, a response wasn’t received from all the members within two weeks. All the pending votes, with already 2 weeks notice period expired, will be casted till the end of the first day (Pacific Time) of the coming month. This way, every member can expect a voting might be happening and they can find voting issues in the dedicated repo. Decisions will be made based on received votes at that time. 

At any time after the initial notification, if more than half of the total number of TSC members sends “favor” or “not in favor”, a decision can be made without waiting for other members, since their vote will have no effect.

Otherwise, voting results are decided based on the total number of “favor” and “not in favor” votes, ignoring “abstain” votes. Whichever vote has a majority will be the decision. If no majority is reached, TSC can continue with a re-election or status-quo is maintained (i.e. no change).

Every decision should be published at a TSC GitHub repo with vote numbers for TSC visibility, and announced publicly.
