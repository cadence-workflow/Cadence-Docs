# Cadence Workflow Open Source Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the Cadence Workflow project. It defines the roles, responsibilities, decision-making processes, and contribution guidelines to ensure transparency, inclusivity, and sustainability within the Cadence open-source community.

---

## Guiding Principles

The governance of the Cadence project adheres to the following principles:

1. **Transparency**: Discussions, decisions, and contributions are made in public forums.  
2. **Inclusivity**: Contributions are welcome from anyone, regardless of affiliation, experience, or background.  
3. **Meritocracy**: Decisions are guided by technical merit and the value of contributions to the community.  
4. **Sustainability**: Processes are designed to ensure the long-term health and success of the project.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Ways to contribute to the Cadence project can be found in [this document](https://cadenceworkflow.io/community/how-to-contribute).

---

## Decision-Making Process

### 1\. Consensus-Based Decisions

Most decisions are made through open discussions on GitHub or community meetings. Contributors and committers work towards consensus, ensuring that all voices are heard.

Based on the requests from the past, feedback during planning sessions and the criticality of the features Cadence core team, which is also the technical steering committee, will propose a plan for the next year or 6 months. 

### 2\. Appeals

If a contributor disagrees with a decision, they can escalate the issue for review through Github or community meetings, explaining why a change in current proposal is necessary by comparing their ideas to existing items in the planning proposal.
