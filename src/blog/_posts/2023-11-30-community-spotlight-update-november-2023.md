Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

It's been a couple of months since our last update so we have a lot of updates to share with you.

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## Proposal for Cadence Native Authentication ##

Community member [Mantas Sidlauskas](https://lt.linkedin.com/in/mantassidlauskas) has drafted a proposal around Cadence native authentication and is asking for community feedback. If you are interested in reviewing the current proposal and providing comments or feedback then please find the proposal details at the link below:

 This is a great example of how we can focus on collaborating together to find a collective solution. A big thank you to Mantas for initiating this work and we hope to see the results of the community input soon!

## iWF Deep Dive and More! ##

During the last few months community member [Quanzheng Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/) has continued to share his thoughts not only about [iWF](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf) tips and tricks but also about workflows and processes. There is now even a [Python SDK](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf-python-sdk) for iWF. Links to Long's articles can be found below:

## New Go Samples for Cadence ##

The Cadence core team is deprecating the old samples for Go and replacing with new V2 samples. We have received a lot of feedback that the people are having trouble with old samples, so we will publish a completely new brand of samples first for Go.

Here are some major changes to the new samples:

- Easy to use the read. New samples will be completely based on CLIs instead of running a binary. (This is consistent with current Cadence use experience)
- Simple and transparent worker configuration. (The old samples did not provide user a clear demonstration about the relationship between the worker and workflow themselves)
- The new samples will help you bootstrap your Cadence workflow much quicker and easier.
- More vivid and self-explanatory. (Instead of traditional HelloWorld  type of samples, we try to make thing more interesting and engaging. Each sample is trying to simulate a real-life use case to make them more understandable and fun to learn.)

If you have any questions or have new sample inquires, please reach out to [Chris Qin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisqin0610).

The new samples can be found at:
-  https://github.com/uber-common/cadence-samples/tree/master/new_samples.

We will be removing the old samples after new samples are fully refreshed.

## Cadence Retrospective ##

We are nearly at the end of another year and yes it has gone so fast! Over this year Cadence and the community have evolved and grown. We think that this would be a good time to reflect about all the things that have happened in the project over the year and think about a possible roadmap for the future.

If you have any feedback, or comments about the project or ideas about what features you'd like to see in the roadmap then please feel free to begin a discussion in the #community [Slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack)  channel.
