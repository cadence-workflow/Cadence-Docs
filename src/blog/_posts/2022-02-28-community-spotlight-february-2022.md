## Community Supporting the Community

During February 16 questions were posted in the Cadence #support [Slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack) channel from new cadence users and existing community members looking for help and guidance. A very big thank you to the following community members who took the time to help others:  Ali, David, Tamas Weisz, Liang Mei, Quanzheng Long, peaceChoi, Emrah Seker, Ben Slater and Sathyaraju Sekaran.

It’s great to see that we are supporting each other - and that is exactly what communities do!

## Help us to Make Cadence even better

Are you interested in helping us improve Cadence? We are always looking for contributors to help share the workload. If you’d like to help then you can start by taking a look at our list of [open issues](https://github.com/uber/cadence/issues) on Github. We currently have 320 of them that need to be worked on so if you want to learn more about Cadence and solve some of the reported issues then please take a look and volunteer to fix it.

If you are new to Cadence or you’d like to try something simple then we have some issues labelled as ‘good first issue’. These are a great place to start to get more Cadence experience.

## Cadence Calendar

We have created a public calendar where we can highlight events, meetings, webinars etc that are planned around Cadence. The calendar will be available on the [Cadence website](https://cadenceworkflow.io/) at the following link.[Cadence Calendar]()
