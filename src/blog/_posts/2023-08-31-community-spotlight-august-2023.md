Welcome to the latest of our regular monthly Community Spotlight updates that gives you news from in and around the Cadence community!

Please see below for a roundup of the highlights:

## More Cadence How To's ##

You might have noticed that we have had a few more contributions to our blog from [Chris Qin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisqin0610). Chris has been busy sharing insights, and tips on a few important Cadence topics. The objective is to help the community with any potential problems.

Here are the latest topics:

- [Bad Practices and Anti-Patterns with Cadence - Part 1](https://cadenceworkflow.io/blog/2023/07/10/cadence-bad-practices-part-1/)

- [Non-Determistic Errors, Replayers and Shadowers](https://cadenceworkflow.io/blog/2023/08/27/nondeterministic-errors-replayers-shadowers/)

Even if you have not encountered these use cases - it is good to be prepared and have a solution ready.Please take a look and let us have your feedback.

Chris is also going to take a look at the [Cadence Samples](https://cadenceworkflow.io/docs/java-client/client-overview/#samples) to make sure they are all working and if not - he's going to re-write them so that they do!

Thanks very much Chris for all the work you are doing to help improve the project!

## More iWF Examaples ##

Community member [Quanzheng Long](https://www.linkedin.com/in/prclqz/) has also been busy writing this month. In previous blogs Long has told us about [iWF](https://github.com/indeedeng/iwf) that is a layer implemented over of Cadence.

During August Long has published a couple of articles on using the 'ContinueAsNew' functionality in iWF. Links to Part 1 and Part are below:

- [Guide to ContinueAsNew in Cadence/Temporal Workflow Using iWF as an example - Part 1](https://medium.com/@qlong/guide-to-continueasnew-in-cadence-temporal-workflow-using-iwf-as-an-example-part-2-cedabd732bec)

## Cadence At the Helm! ##

Last month we mentioned the Cadence Helm charts and all the previous work that had been done by [Mark Sagi-Kazar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sagikazarmark/). We were looking to ensure they are maintained.

So a special thanks goes out this month to [Edmondo](ttps://github.com/edmondop ) for contributing some work on the [Cadence Helm Chart](https://github.com/edmondop/cadence-helm-chart/).

## Community Support! ##

Our [Slack](http://t.uber.com/cadence-slack) channel continues to be the main place where people are asking for help and support with Cadence. During August (which is supposed to be holiday season), we still had 9 questions raised around various topics.

Huge thanks to the following community members who took time to respond and help others: David, Edmondo, Chris Qin, Rony Rahman and Ben Slater.

It's good to see that we are continuing to support each other - doing exactly what communities do!
