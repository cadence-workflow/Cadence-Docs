> 📚 **New to contributing to Cadence?** Check out our [Contributing Guide](https://cadenceworkflow.io/community/how-to-contribute/getting-started) for an overview of the contribution process across all Cadence repositories. This document contains cadence backend specific setup and development instructions.

### Installation

```console
npm install
```

### Local Development

```console
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window at http://localhost:3000/. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```console
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Environment Variables

In order to deploy to multiple environments, some configuration options in `docusaurus.config.ts` are made available for override through environment variables.

```bash
# Can be replaced by your GH pages url, ie. https://<userId>.github.io/
CADENCE_DOCS_URL=https://cadenceworkflow.io

# For GitHub pages deployment, it is often /<projectName>/ defaults to `/`
BASE_URL=/cadence-docs/

# For Github pages only, this is your Github org/user name.
ORGANIZATION_NAME=cadence-workflow
```

#### CNAME

A file `static/CNAME` should be present in order to deploy to a [github pages site that uses a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site). I.E. cadenceworkflow.io
This file is created by the deploy action, but if deploying from a local environment, care should be taken to ensure the file exists.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```console
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```console
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.


### Updating Release Data

The release pages rely on data from GitHub that is persisted as json files under `static/data/releases/`.
In order to update the release information for display, this can be done manually or be set up as part of the CI/CD process by running the `scripts/fetch-releases.sh` script. Script uses the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to fetch the release data.

Automatic updates to release data are performed by a github action `fetch-release-data`. Which will check if new data is available, and if so update the release data with the latest information and open a branch named `fetch-release-data` and open a PR if one is not open already.

Manual approval is required before merging and continuing to deployment.

# NPM Registry

Ensure you have a `.npmrc` [file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/configuring-npm/npmrc/) configured with `registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/`.
This will ensure the dependencies are pulled from the correct source and to prevent internal npm registries from being pushed onto the package-lock.json
